        		<h1>Attila Varga</h1>
				<p>I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University. Here I work collaboratively with the <a href="http://yongyeol.com/">YY group</a> and other members of the <a href="https://cnets.indiana.edu/">Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research</a> on the <a href="https://minerva.defense.gov/Research/Funded-Projects/Article/1931771/science-genome-a-scholarly-graph-embedding-framework/">Science Genome Project</a>. I have a PhD in sociology from the University of Arizona. </p>
				<p>My general research interests lie at the crossroads of network analysis and the sociology of science. Currently I am exploring the evolution of scholarly communication to learn about the changing organizational practices of academic research. I am especially interested in the long term deep structural change induced by the exponential growth of literature output, the fast growth of global scientific workforce, and new communication technologies. The theoretical framework that motivates my thinking is rooted Mertonian sociology, and it revolves around the inherent tensions of academia, such as the tension between reputation driven judgement of scientific claims versus universalist judegement, or the pressure of novelty seeking versus the natural occurrence of intellectual stagnation. My research is published in <em>PLOS One</em>, <em>PNAS</em>, and <em>Scientometrics</em>. </p>
